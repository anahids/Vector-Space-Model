experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream .
  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
  the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

approximate solutions of the incompressible laminar
boundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow .
  the two-dimensional steady boundary-layer
problem for a flat plate in a
shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered .
solutions for the boundary-
layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocity
distribution in the boundary
layer are obtained by the karman-pohlhausen
technique .  comparison with
the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also
been made to show the effect of
vorticity .

similarity laws for stressing heated wings .
  it will be shown that the differential equations for a heated
plate with large temperature gradient and for a similar plate at
constant temperature can be made the same by a proper
modification of the thickness and the loading for the isothermal plate .
this fact leads to the result that the stresses in the heated plate
can be calculated from measured strains on the unheated plate by
a series of relations, called the /similarity laws ./  the
application of this analog theory to solid wings under aerodynamic
heating is discussed in detail .  the loading on the unheated analog
wing is, however, complicated and involves the novel concept
of feedback and /body force/ loading .  the problem of stressing
a heated box-wing structure can be solved by the same analog
method and is briefly discussed .
