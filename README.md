# Vector-Space-Model
Title:  “Project 3: Vector Space Model”
Deadline: 6/November/2019 (11:59 pm)
No project will be accepted after the established deadline without any exception.
Description of the project:
The goal of this project is to implement the vector space model used for ranking documents. Using the Cranfield Dataset Collection, the student will implement the vector space model.

Implementation:
1. Information Retrieval GUI – To create a graphical interface containing the following parts:
  a. Input query – A dropbox where you can select a query.
  b. Model – Two options can be shown: Binary Model(project 1) and the Vector Space Model.
  c. Search – This search will applied the previously selected model in (b) and the ranking results will be displayed in the results section.
  d. Results section – In this section, there will be a list of the ranked documents (implementing pagination if necessary,  if there are more documents that what can be shown in the list), displaying the following:  number of document, title, the sentence where the query match, ranking coefficient.
  e. Clear button – This button will clear the results section and will reset the chosen options.
  f. Precision and Recall button – After you click this button a precision and recall graph will be shown. Graphs can be exported to a pdf file. The plotted graph will be the average of 10 different queries using the model selected.
2. Implement the vector space model
3. Testing: Using the Cranfield Collection Dataset, create some test so you can show how your algorithm works.
4. Precision/Recall graph
Deliverables:
1.- Implementation – To upload all the source code of your implementation in a folder called /project3. All teams will be called to explain your project. The project will contain three different components: a folder called /code, presentation, report. The lack of this structure will be decrement the grade of the implementation.
2.- Report – This is a PDF document containing the following. The length is of a maximum of 6 pages, using the given latex template.
  a. Title
  b. Abstract
  c. Introduction
  d. Objective (general and particular)
  e. Description of the problem
  f. Methodology
  g. Results and Analysis
  h. Conclusions
  i. References
3.- Presentation – All teams must prepare a 20 minute presentation about the project answering the following questions. Two randomly selected teams will be presenting in class.
  a. What is the topic about?
  b. An introduction of the topic.
  c. What techniques did you use to build your software and why?
  d. Presenting the results, explaining your very own experiences and lessons learnt.
Notes:
• Every person in each team have to talk at least a third of the total time for teams with three people and half of the time for teams of two people. All presentation will be fully in English and you need to make a presentation in powerpoint.
• Despite the presentation is by teams, this will be marked individually.

Rubric:
Report 30
Implementation 50
Presentation 20
Total 100

Important:
1. In case of finding any sort of plagiarism during the presentation of the project/implementation/report, the grade will be zero.
2. All deliverables will be uploaded in a folder called /project3 into the sharepoint in your folder previously created called /projects.
